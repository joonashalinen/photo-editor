- with multiple tools having been used, saving image saves multiple images of the image with different tool features showing or not showing

- changing or loading image enables/selects drawing tool by default

- rotating and then applying filters breaks rotation, edit: now it shifts by a few pixels every time, this adds up over rotations

- addText() uses this.originalImageData.width/height to calculate x, y position but does it get updated when rotating?

- after rotating, on mobile touch the draw tool draws on wrong coordinates
